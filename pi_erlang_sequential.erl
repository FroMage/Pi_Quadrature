%%%  The obvious algorithm uses some form of list either explicitly as below or via the use of map or
%%%  mapfoldr.  This list-based approach cannot work for the huge numbers of iterations we have here as
%%%  there is just not enough memory.  The only way out of this is to use tail recursion to do iteration.
