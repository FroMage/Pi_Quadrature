//  This variant on the sequential code was proposed by Andrey Mirtchovski in a private email in reply to an
//  email by Russel Winder on the GoLang Nuts email list.  It involves changing the types of n and i so as
//  to avoid the conversions from int to float64 in the inner loop.  This increases performance by 3 fold.
