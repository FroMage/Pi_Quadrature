//  This variant of the sequential code was proposed by Andrey Mirtchovski in a private email in reply to an
//  email by Russel Winder on the GoLang Nuts email list.  It involves changing the types of n and i so as
//  to avoid the conversions from int to float64 in the inner loop.  This increases performance by 3 fold.
//  The speculation is that go 6g uses the CVTSL2SD instruction with an mmx register (the instruction
//  "converts doubleword integer to scalar double-precision floating-point value") and that the way the
//  toolchain generates code leads to code that stalls the pipeline.  But note this is an
//  hypothesis/speculation to explain the observed behaviour.  Note that the C and C++ code also uses this
//  instruction but fails to create the delay.
