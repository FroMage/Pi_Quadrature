#  Calculation of Pi using quadrature.  Using threads -- but this gives no parallelism because of the GIL.
#  If the append operation on a list is atomic then we can just use a list as the mechanism for receiving
#  the results.  However it is not clear that that operation is atomic so we use a Queue as the way of
#  receiving results since that has the necessary guarantees to be thread-safe.
