Use Float not Decimal so as to get some form of sane performance – Decimals are realized as
java.math.BigDecimal which whilst accurate are extraordinarily slow compared to java.lang.Double, which is
how Floats are realized – actually it is double, but let's not worry about that.

Int type in Fantom is 64-bit and there is no 32-bit integer type.  This means Fantom running on the JVM will
always suffer the obvious JVM JIT startup issue.  Using a closure for the tight loop should allow the JIT to
kick in so range-based code should be faster than a simple for loop.
