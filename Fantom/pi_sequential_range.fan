 *  Use Float not Decimal so as to get some form of sane performance -- Decimals are realized as
 *  java.math.BigDecimal which whilst accurate are extraordinarily slow compared to java.lang.Double which
 *  is how Floats are realized.
 *
 *  Int type in Fantom is 64-bit and there is no 32-bit integer type.  This means Fantom running on the JVM
 *  will always suffer the obvious JVM JIT startup issue.  Using a closure for the tight loop allows the JIT
 *  to kick in so this code will be faster than a simple for loop!
