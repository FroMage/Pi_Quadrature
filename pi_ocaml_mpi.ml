(*

  An OCaml program to calculate Pi using quadrature.  This is an SPMD realization using OpenMPI under the
  OCaml MPI bindings.

(* Sys.time measures processor time of the process and not elapse time.  The two are (roughly) the same for
single process programs.  For MPI programs however, there are multiple processes and so Sys.time is not
adequate to the task.  For now assume that Unix.gettimeofday is implemented on the execution platform. *)
