 *  There is an article about rdtsc on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDTSC).  It's GCC solution
 *  seems safe but slow.  The Visual C++ version appears a lot more efficient but note it does not do
 *  inlining, it has to be a real function.
 *
 *  The article recommends serializing the rdstc instruction by using the cpuid instruction.  %eax holds the
 *  parameter to the cpuid instruction, possible values are 0, 1 or 2.  cpuid fills in %eax, %ebx, %ecx,
 *  %edx.  rdtsc fills in %eax and %edx.
 *
 *   rdtscp is not a legal instruction despite what it says at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDTSC.

 *  We can get something seemingly very much more efficient by making the assumption that: %edx:%eax is the

 *  and the compiler is happy to ignore non-void functions not having a return statement.  However, this
 *  cannot be inlined.  So the question is whether the function call is more costly that the various move
 *  and xorl instructions.  Its a pity we cannot also make this naked.
