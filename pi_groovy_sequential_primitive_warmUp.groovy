// This is Groovy and so extraordinarily slow compared to Java.  Use primitive types though so as to avoid
// really bad performance due to use of Integer and BigDecimal.  Hence the careful markup of the literals as

//  Speed issue parameters: int is faster than long; classic for may be faster than "foreach" style for; **
//  operator appears slow in comparison to using a variable and * --
//  cf. pi_groovy_sequential_primitive_alt.groovy.

//  This version is to show that JVM warm up doesn't really make much of a difference to Groovy evaluation.
