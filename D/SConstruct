## DMD 2.059 worked, DMD 2.060 had issues – various problems with threads. GDC on Debian as at
## 2012-09-06 realizes D 2.056 and barfs on some constructs introduced after that version. LDC compiled
## from master/HEAD as at 2012-11--11 is D 2.060+changes and works fine. Except for
## pi_d_threadsGlobalState_array_declarative.d. See http://d.puremagic.com/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=8774. It
## appears that pi_d_threadsGlobalState_array_declarative.d should never have worked under 2.059 as it was:
## maps are iterable but lazy, the array needs to be instantiated for the algorithm to work as required.
##
##  pi_d_threadsGlobalState_array_iterative.d and pi_d_threadsGlobalState_threadGroup.d fail on DMD 2.060
##  but worked under 2.059, and work under LDC2.
##
## As at 2014-04-21, DMD at version 2.065 works fine. as does LDC compiled from master (794d5d, v2.063.2,
## LLVM 3.4). GDC 4.8.1 however gives some errors compiling std.parallelism.

## As at 2013-04-21, SCons mainline repository has all the D tools in that work properly :-)
